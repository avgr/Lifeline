1	I knew Brother Branham was true	but this more or less proved it:

2	they had a big long line one	night; people were wanting to be prayed for

3	Brother Branham got real quiet,	this funny look came on his face,

4	he said to this man,

5	"You're an impostor, there's	nothing wrong with you."

6	So if there was any doubt, 	that told you right there

7	because he went on and 	prayed for that man

8	could've said, "So and so is 	wrong with you" but he didn't

9	he said, "You're an imposter."

10	I don't remember if that man got	out alive or exactly what he done,

11	but I just remember that so clear. 	He just got the funniest look on his face,

12	and I thought, 	"Well I wonder why he's

13	getting that look?" 	Well I knew, that man's an imposter.

14	He thought Brother Branham	would say, "You got TB or you got

15	this or that" and he didn't do it. 	It just proved he was true

16	We went regular. We didn't miss a time.	I remember one Sunday morning,

17	I was opening something and cut my finger	real bad. I had to go to emergency room

18	and they fixed it up. I thought, well I'm going to church	because it's not bad. 

19	I got there and they said, "Well here she is	coming in!" They'd been praying for me.

20	We didn't miss none. 	My mother... you didn't miss church. No. 

21	We stood in line, we stood in	the rain, the cold, and the snow

22	It didn't matter, we just stood in line.

23	Everybody eventually got a seat.	A lot of the men would get up and let

24	the ladies sit down. 	If they had a little child,

25	and most everybody got a seat.

26	We had to stand in the old building	because there wasn't enough seats.

27	One time we had it outside, 	had chairs outside. Nobody did care.

28	We just set out there in the sun. 	I think that was at Easter time.

29	And we were sitting there. It was on	Sunday morning, and Brother Way and

30	Sister Way was right in front. And	all of a sudden, Brother Way was just gone

31	and Brother Branham didn't get excited, 

32	he said just "All be real quiet,	be reverent, and I'm going to go

33	down and pray for Brother Way."	So he comes down off the pulpit

34	and prayed for Brother Way.

35	Everybody bowed their heads and prayed.

36	He never said no more, but went	right back up to the pulpit.

37	Brother Way revived,	got alright, went out to eat that day

38	after church and was there that night.

39	That was wonderful!

40	Brother Way, he was	raised from the dead

41	right there in front of me.

42	I've seen a lot of people get out of wheelchairs,

43	get off of their beds and things,

44	but I never got to go to any 	of the meetings away from here

45	so I didn't see any of the	great miracles, only that one

46	but that was wonderful, yeah.

47	(interviewer) What describes him? What was it	like to see him or be around him?

48	Well he was a very meek and humble person,

49	and I know he loved God with all his heart,

50	and I know he was a true prophet of God.

51	He just was humble with it. 

52	He didn't want nobody to 	make him anything big,

53	but he was just humble,

54	and everybody that 	I know just loved him,

55	and he just had the love of Jesus in him

56	till there wasn't no room for nothing else.
